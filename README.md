</p>

SpinFOURKAYYY makes the complete EverQuest Legends interface easier to read on 4K, ultrawide, and other high-resolution monitors. Choose the size that feels right, launch EverQuest normally, and the app prepares your personal UI layout for you.

It works with the default UI, custom interfaces, and character-specific layouts. Your macros, hotbuttons, keybinds, spell sets, chat settings, and other character data are left alone.

## What it does

- Offers every UI size from **100% to 200%** in simple 1% steps.
- Automatically fits your existing layout to the size you choose.
- Remembers layout changes separately for each size.
- Restores your native layout when EverQuest exits.
- Keeps supported DPS meters and companion overlays above the scaled game.
- Includes readable presets for a quick, good-looking setup.
- Uses safe backups and recovery if the game, app, or Windows closes unexpectedly.
- Runs alongside EverQuest without injecting into or modifying the game.

## Quick start

1. Download the latest ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/itsspin/SPINFOURKAYYY/releases/latest).
2. Extract the entire ZIP into its own folder.
3. Open `SpinFOURKAYYY.exe` and choose your monitor and UI size.
4. Click **Start EverQuest for me**, then patch and sign in through the normal launcher.
5. Keep SpinFOURKAYYY open while playing and exit EverQuest normally when finished.

Your first launch at a new size may take a moment while the app prepares a matching copy of your current layout. After that, you can play normally and move windows or edit hotbars as usual. Those layout changes are saved for that size when the game closes.

## Choosing a size

- **100% · Native pixels** keeps the original game image and UI size.
- **110–125%** is a great starting range for a clearer, gently enlarged interface.
- **150% · Balanced** gives a noticeably larger and easier-to-read UI.
- **200% · Comfort** provides the largest interface for maximum readability.

**Readable UI** is the recommended quality mode. If small text looks soft, leave anti-aliasing off and try a slightly larger size instead of adding more sharpening.

Choose your settings before launching. To change size or quality later, exit EverQuest, select the new options, and start a fresh managed session.

## Companion overlays

Leave **Keep companion overlays visible** enabled for Loremaster, DPS meters, and similar companion HUDs. SpinFOURKAYYY keeps recognized overlays above the scaled game without resizing their pixels, so their text remains native and sharp.

For the best results, start the overlay before launching EverQuest and run the overlay, EverQuest, and SpinFOURKAYYY at the same Windows privilege level.

## Try SpinUI

SpinFOURKAYYY works with any EverQuest UI, but it pairs especially well with **SpinUI**—our complete EverQuest Legends interface overhaul with matching layouts and useful companion tools.

### [Visit the SpinUI GitHub repository →](https://github.com/itsspin/spinips)

SpinUI is completely optional. Select **Current/default/custom UI** in SpinFOURKAYYY if you want to keep using your existing interface.

## Helpful notes

- EverQuest must be closed before starting a new managed session.
- Extract the release completely; do not run it from inside the ZIP.
- Keep `SpinFOURKAYYY.exe` and the included `Engine` folder together.
- Administrator access is not required or recommended.
- Close any separately installed copy of Magpie before launching.
- If a session is interrupted, reopen SpinFOURKAYYY and let it finish recovery.

## Compatibility

- Windows 10 version 1903 or newer, or Windows 11
- AMD, NVIDIA, and compatible Intel graphics
